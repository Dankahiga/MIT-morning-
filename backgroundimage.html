<h1 style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: left;"> Classical Music Composers</h1>
<h2  style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: left;">Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827)</h2>
<img src="images/beethoven.jpeg" height="225" width="225"/>
<p style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: justify;"> The German composer and pianist Ludwig van Beethoven is widely regarded as the greatest composer who ever lived. He expanded the Classical traditions of Joseph Haydn, one of his teachers, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and experimented with personal expression, a characteristic that influenced the Romantic composers who succeeded him. His life and career were marked by progressive deafness, yet the malady did not prevent him from composing some of his most important works during the last 10 years of his life when he was nearly unable to hear. Widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartet, Beethoven’s notable works include Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125, Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67, Moonlight Sonata, and Für Elise. </p>

<h2  style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: left;">Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750)</h2>
<img src="images/bach.jpeg" height="168" width="300"/>
<p style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: justify;">Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and organist of the Baroque period. His contemporaries admired him for his talent as a musician but thought his compositions were old-fashioned. A rediscovery of his work in the early 19th century led to the so-called Bach revival, in which he came to be seen as one of the greatest composers of all time. His most-celebrated compositions include Brandenburg Concertos, The Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 846–893, Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, BWV 1007–1012, Orchestral Suites, BWV 1066–1069, and Mass in B Minor, BWV 232.</p>

<h2 style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: left;">  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–91)</h2>
<img src="images/mozart.jpeg" height="194" width="259"/>
<p style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: justify;">An Austrian composer of the Classical period, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is widely recognized as one of the greatest composers of Western music. He is the only composer to write and excel in all of the musical genres of his time. Rumored to have had the ability to play music at age three and to write music at age five, Mozart began his career as a child prodigy. Notable compositions include The Marriage of Figaro, Elvira Madigan, and Clarinet Quintet in A Major, K 581.</p>

 <h2 style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: left;">Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741)</h2>
<img src="images/vivaldi.jpeg" height="248" width="203"/>
<p style=" color: aliceblue;text-align: justify;"> solo instruments, and small ensembles, but he is often celebrated for his concerti, in which virtuoso solo passages alternate with passages for the whole orchestra. He wrote about 500 concerti, of which his best-known work is the group of four violin concerti titled The Four Seasons. His Mandolin Concerto in C Major, RV 425, Concerto for Four Violins and Cello in B Minor, Op. 3, No.10 and Concerto for Two Trumpets in C Major are equally playful and complex. </p>
Antonio Vivaldi was an Italian composer and violinist of the Baroque period. He wrote music for operas,
