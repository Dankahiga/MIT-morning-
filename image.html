It has caught on with students who want to learn all of the skill sets required to build a whole machine by themselves.
    Mechatronics is a crossover form of engineering born out of the need for engineers with both electrical and mechanical knowledge. Before the 1970s, most household products relied on mechanical engineering alone in their design. Even large manufacturing plants were powered by people controlling mechanically driven devices. The early 1970s saw a shift towards incorporating electrical power with mechanical features into our tools and machines.
    Think of all of the items in your home that move and are powered by electricity : your washing machine, your ceiling fan, your food processor, your power drill. Designing and building all of the moving parts in your washing machine required mechanical know-how, someone who could make the parts spin just right. But to power the device, that engineer also had to have electrical skills too.
    In the 1980s, with the boom in microprocessors, mechatronics grew more popular. By the 90s, the field began to incorporate aspects of computer science and programming, creating almost endless possibilities to the usefulness of mechatronics engineering. mechatronics engineering in the auto industry
    With all of that crossover knowledge, mechatronics engineers have brought amazing features into the products they work on. Cars are a great example.  </span> </p>
