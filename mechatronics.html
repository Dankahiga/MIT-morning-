<p style="color: aqua"> <b>Mechatronics <mark> is a branch of engineering </mark>that <mark>focuses on designing, manufacturing and maintaining </mark>products that have both mechanical and electronic components. The term was coined in 1969 by engineer Tetsuro Mori to describe the synergy that exists between electrical control systems and the mechanical machines they regulate. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened to include the integration of multiple other disciplines, including computer engineering, systems engineering and programming.</b></p>

<h1 style="color: #e85e22;text-align:left;font-size: 60px;font-family:'chiller'">The Evolution of Mechatronics Engineering</h1>
<p><mark>Mechatronics</mark> began as an A to Z kind of engineering for a new technological age. It has caught on with students who want to learn all of the skill sets required to build a whole machine by themselves.
    Mechatronics is a crossover form of engineering born out of the need for engineers with both electrical and mechanical knowledge. Before the 1970s, most household products relied on mechanical engineering alone in their design. Even large manufacturing plants were powered by people controlling mechanically driven devices. The early 1970s saw a shift towards incorporating electrical power with mechanical features into our tools and machines.
    Think of all of the items in your home that move and are powered by electricity: your washing machine, your ceiling fan, your food processor, your power drill. Designing and building all of the moving parts in your washing machine required mechanical know-how, someone who could make the parts spin just right. But to power the device, that engineer also had to have electrical skills too.
    In the 1980s, with the boom in microprocessors, mechatronics grew more popular. By the 90s, the field began to incorporate aspects of computer science and programming, creating almost endless possibilities to the usefulness of mechatronics engineering. mechatronics engineering in the auto industry
    With all of that crossover knowledge, mechatronics engineers have brought amazing features into the products they work on. Cars are a great example. Backup cameras, sensors, and anti-lock breaks all required crossover engineering skills to design and implement. Areas like automation and robotics are also full of mechatronics engineers.

“If you build a mechanical thing that is controlled by electrical components that needs software to make it work, then you need mechatronics,” says Capitol’s dean of academics and chair of electrical engineering.</p>

<h1>What Does A Mechatronic Engineer Do?</h1>
<p>Mechatronics engineers <mark>design and develop electro-mechanical systems as well as computer control systems </mark> for manufacturing equipment. They develop programming logic for manufacturing equipment and also select the required tools and materials for the manufacturing process. They develop project specifications and recommend modifications when needed and also identify areas of weakness in the production line or finished products.</p>
